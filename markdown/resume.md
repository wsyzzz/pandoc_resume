    * Core developer of the flagship product (The Author of Ranplan Radiowave 
    Propagation Model)     
    * OpenCL GPU Implementation of Vector Ray Launching Propagation Algorithms
    * Prototyping the Geo-localization algorithm using KNN and other machine 
    learning algorithms.
    * Develop the 32/64-bit cutting-edge wireless radiowave propagation engine 
    (plugins, scripts) using C++, Delphi and Inline Assembly.
    * Research, bug-fixes and development for an indoor wireless planning tool 
    using C#
    * Develop and maintain web-based licensing software using 
    PHP + MySQL + Javascript.
    * Develop Hundreds of Unit Tests and Integration Tests in 
    C# and VBScript.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Projects
:   I have developed tons of handy tools/libraries at my spare time.

    * A set of Steem Block Chain Tools: https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit/
    * A few useful Chrome Extensions: https://helloacm.com/tools/
    * A few APIs: https://helloacm.com/list-of-apis/

    bugs and create issues or PR to other open source libraries. My github
    id is *doctorlai*

Programming Languages
:   **Quite familiar with:** C99, C++ 17, C# 7.0, Delphi XE10, Javascript (JQuery), Python 2/3, PHP 7.x, HTML5/CSS, SQL 

:   **second-lang:** BASH, AWK, LATEX, LUA  

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** LOGO, VBScript

:   Basic knowledge of **Java**, **x86 assembly**

Bio
----------------------------------------
* I am one of the lead developers for this product (C#7, .NET4.7): https://www.ranplan.co.uk/products/
* I design, develop and maintain the core library (Radio Propagation engine). It is a 500K LOC code base that consists of Visual Studio C++ 2017, Delphi 10.2 Tokyo with some Inline Assembly and some VBS/JS
* I had several programming competition awards on National Olympics Informatics (NOI) back in High School. 
* My propagation model 'IRLA' is well-known in both academia and industrials. It has been cited in the book "Femtocells - Technologies and Deployment", John Wiley & Sons, 328 pages, Jan. 2010, ISBN: 978-0-470-74298-3. 
* I write highly-optimized code (which uses less memory and executes faster).  For example, for Problem 1532 on ACM Timus Online Judge, my submission ranks the second. The maximum time allowed is 4 seconds but my algorithm executes in 0.312 seconds.  http://acm.timus.ru/rating.aspx?space=1&num=1532&count=100 
* I am also good at SEO. My domains rank high in Google.
* I manage 5 VPS (Ubuntu) for a long time e.g. 8 yrs. These servers are used for my side projects. 
* I am a highly-motivated learner and have a great passion for technologies! 
* Human Languages:
     * Chinese Mandarin (Native Speaker)
     * English (Fluent)
* BlockChain:
     * I run a delegated service on steem blockchain @justyy where Steemians delegate their Steem Power to me and my bots send out the Steem Dollars (tokens) at a rate of 8% to 10%. Also my bots are up running 24/7 to vote the quality posts of the delegatees. 
     * I also run @dailychina where the algorithms select top 10 quality posts and reward them daily (very popular and postive feedbacks received).
