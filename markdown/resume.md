----------

**Ranplan Wireless (Cambridgeshire, UK)**
*Principal Software Engineer, 2010 to present*: I am one of the lead developers for this product (C#7, .NET4.7): [https://www.ranplan.co.uk/products/](https://www.ranplan.co.uk/products/)  and I design, develop and maintain the core library (Radio Propagation engine). It is a 500K LOC code base that consists of Visual Studio C++ 2017, Delphi 10.2 Tokyo with some Inline Assembly and some VBS/JS.

* Agile/Scrum
* Core developer of the flagship product: The Author of Ranplan Radiowave Propagation Model.
* Lead a Propagation Team e.g. Rewrite RPM in C++.
* OpenCL GPU Implementation of Vector Ray Launching Propagation Algorithms.
* Prototyping the Geo-localization algorithm using KNN and other machine learning algorithms.
* Develop the 32/64-bit cutting-edge wireless radiowave propagation engine (plugins, scripts) using C++, Delphi and Inline Assembly.
* Research, bug-fixes and development for an indoor wireless planning tool using C#.
* Develop and maintain web-based licensing software using PHP + MySQL + Javascript.
* Develop Hundreds of Unit Tests and Integration Tests in C# and VBScript.
* Develop More than 1500 APIs using Delphi.
* Develop Tools of Statistics and Code Quality on Jenkins Continuous Server Powershell.
* Develop Smart/Intelligent algorithms to convert clutter GIS data to vector building data.
* Develop various GIS conversion/cropping tools.
* Refactoring and Cleanup Code (produce a much cleaner/elegant code).

**University of Sheffield, UK**

Technical Experience
--------------------

Side Projects
:   I have developed tons of handy tools/libraries at my spare time.
- A set of Steem Block Chain Tools: [https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit/](https://helloacm.com/tools/steemit/)
- A few useful Chrome Extensions: [https://helloacm.com/tools/](https://helloacm.com/tools/)
- A few APIs: [https://helloacm.com/list-of-apis/](https://helloacm.com/list-of-apis/)
- A few Libraries such as SteemVBS: [https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemvbs](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steemvbs) which is the VBScript library to connect to steem blockchain.

Open Source
:   I love github! most of my tools are open source and I constantly find
    bugs and create issues or PR to other open source libraries. My github
    id is *doctorlai*

Programming Languages
:   C99, C++ 17, C# 7.0, Java 7, Delphi XE10, Javascript (JQuery), Python 2/3, PHP 7.x, HTML5/CSS, SQL, BASH, AWK, LATEX, LUA, LOGO, VBScript, x86 Assembly 

Operating System
:   Ubuntu (I manage a few VPS), Windows 10

Others
----------------------------------------
* My propagation model 'IRLA' is well-known in both academia and industrials. It has been cited in the book "Femtocells - Technologies and Deployment", John Wiley & Sons, 328 pages, Jan. 2010, ISBN: 978-0-470-74298-3. 
* I write highly-optimized code (which uses less memory and executes faster). For example, for Problem 1532 on ACM Timus Online Judge, my submission ranks the second. The maximum time allowed is 4 seconds but my algorithm executes in 0.312 seconds. [http://acm.timus.ru/rating.aspx?space=1&num=1532&count=100](http://acm.timus.ru/rating.aspx?space=1&num=1532&count=100)
* BlockChain:
     * I run a delegated service on steem blockchain [\@justyy](https://steemd.com/@justyy) where Steemians delegate their Steem Power to me and my bots send out the Steem Dollars (tokens) at a rate of 8% to 10%. Also my bots are up running 24/7 to vote the quality posts of the delegatees. 
     * I also run [\@dailychina](https://steemd.com/@dailychina) where the algorithms select top 10 quality posts and reward them daily (very popular and postive feedbacks received).
